India
    </h1>

<p>
    India, officially the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[21] is a country in South Asia. It is the
    seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country as of June 2023;[22][23] and from the time of its
    independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy.[24][25][26] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the
    Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the
    west;[j] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in
    the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand,
    Myanmar, and Indonesia.

    Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[28][29][30] Their long
    occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only
    to Africa in human genetic diversity.[31] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus
    river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[32]
    Between 2000 BCE and 1500 BCE, Indo-Aryans migrated into India from the northwest, bringing with them Sanskrit, an
    Indo-European language.[33][34] Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by an oral tradition
    that was resolutely vigilant, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[35] The Dravidian languages of India
    were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[36] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged
    within Hinduism,[37] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[38] Early
    political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[39] Their
    collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[40] but also marked by the declining status of women,[41] and
    the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[k][42] In South India, the Middle kingdoms
    exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[43]

<h1>
    Etymology
</h1>
<p>
    According to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name "India" is derived from the Classical Latin
    India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east. In turn the name "India" derived successively from
    Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία), ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός), Old Persian Hindush (an eastern province of the
    Achaemenid Empire), and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or "river", specifically the Indus River and, by
    implication, its well-settled southern basin.[73][74] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which
    translates as "The people of the Indus".[75]
    
    The term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] ⓘ), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of
    India,[76][77] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name
    Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to North India,[78][79] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th
    century as a native name for India.[76][80]
    
    Hindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] ⓘ) is a Middle Persian name for India that became popular by the 13th century,[81] and was used
    widely since the era of the Mughal Empire. The meaning of Hindustan has varied, referring to a region encompassing
    present-day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety.[76][80][82]

<h1>History</h1>
<h3>Ancient India</h3>
<p>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where
they had earlier evolved.[28][29][30] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years
ago.[28] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and
storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan.[84] These gradually
developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[85][84] the first urban culture in South Asia,[86] which flourished during
2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.[87] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and
Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and
wide-ranging trade.[86]</p>
